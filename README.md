## Tokens

- In `.env`, you may have to create and manage a Github Classic Token for it to work (p1bot). You can also set an expiration date on that token (1 year for example).

See more [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

Scope: Repo (all) & admin:repo_hook(all) may be sufficient depending on your case.

## Run the app

`bundle exec dotenv bin/cla-enforcer`
